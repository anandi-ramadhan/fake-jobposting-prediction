```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
job <- read_csv('dataset/fake_job_postings.csv')
job
```

```{r}
glimpse(job)
```

```{r}
summary(job)
```

There are 17,880 records. 4.843% jobs posted are fraudulent. We're dealing with a class-imbalanced problem.

## Data Cleaning

There is a column named 'function' in the dataset which conflicts R's base function. This can be annoying later, so we're going to fix this.
Also, the job_id variable won't do a lot of good either, so we're dropping this variable now.

Once done, we'll go ahead to look for missing values.

```{r}
job <- job %>% 
  rename(func = `function`) %>% 
  select(-job_id)

library(visdat)

vis_miss(job)
```

It's clear to see the salary_range is the variable which has the most missing values. Let's find out why this occured.
